# card-3d-rotate-effect

This is the cool project for the special kind of effect that can be used on cards (or anything else). This is 3d rotate effect which looks nice and cool. In this project you will find the index.html file which you can open in your browser to see what is the effect that I am talking about.

Open index.html file in your browser and hover mouse over one of the 3 cards. You will see that the cards rotates just like real. Is'n it?

# About Images

I have used images from [unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com/) website which is a collection of freestock images.
You don't have to download images by your self. It will be included in the 'img' folder. However, you can replace them by your own images.

#### Hope It will help you in your project.
